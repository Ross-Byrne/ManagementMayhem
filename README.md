Bugs: This project is by no means finished!
==========================================

The biggest major bug that I know of is, if the player gets the bad reputation too high
(not 100% sure how high, but close to max bad rep), the player gets a negitive income, 
as in gets charged. This is because of the way the "productivity bonus" mechanic works.

I have not had time to do anymore work on this project as I am too busy with other
college work. This is just the list of bugs I've noticed so far.

================

I do intend on finishing off this project!

Management Mayhem is meant to be a game.
Athough, because it was a college project and I had limited time,
I did not get time to finish the game and add in all the features I wanted.
Because of this, Management Mayhem is more like a simulator then a game.

================
The list of features I want to add to the game.
===============================================

I had planned on adding in randomly generated events, as the player cycled through
the months (making it an actual game, not simulator) but I ran out of time.
So for a start, here are the features I wish to add.

* Randomly generated events as the player cycles through the months
  This would include eg. parts of the building getting damaged because the 
  maintenance level is too low etc...

* I want to add a proper UI to the game. This would be first on the list only,
  I actually want it to be a game first, which I feel it isn't without the feature above.

* Make the player's traits do more then increase/decrease rep

* Following the above feature, I want to give the player different options when dealing
  with a random event, depending on a certain trait they picked.

That will do for now!
